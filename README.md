# BSS-FPI-GROUP-A
The BSS (Bike Sharing System) Group A, 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The bike-sharing system allows urban residents to rent a bike at one of the rental stations located in the city, use them for their journey, and return them to any other or the same station 
Cities radically change into smart cities because of the increasing mobility of societies, urban growth, new products, and technological innovations. Also, these factors enforce the need to properly shape travellers’ behaviour. Currently, in many cities in urban areas, the biggest challenge is to overcome the problem of the prevailing use of private cars. Bike-sharing systems are considered to be an effective tool for popularizing alternative ways of traveling, and can be used as an element of enhancing sustainable mobility in cities. Sustainable mobility is the communication behavior of users shaped in this way in the spatial structure and transport, in which the length of the travel route is rationalized, individual motorization does not degrade public transport and non-motorized transport (walking and cycling), and the functioning of the transport system makes it possible to maintain harmony with the environment. Sustainable transport is conducive to improving the city’s image and spatial order, as well as creating good quality public space, and also reduces the diversity in the development and quality of life of individual city areas. Contemporary system solutions that connect space and transport planning aim for greater use of the bike as a means of transport.



1. Project Overview
A bike sharing system (Mobile Application)  will be developed with the aims to solve the issue of stolen bikes, identification of each bike, tracing of bike movement and also of the data of bikes and the users.

2. Obstacles
The things that may be obstacles in this project is how to track each bike, it may require us building a tracker device which we may not be able to build, but using an alternative of user smartphone GPS.

3. Technical Obstacles
The technical obstacles it may face in this project is integrating the user smartphone tracking system (GPS) data to the Bike Sharing System.

4. Budgetary Risks
The System will cost us a huge cash base on the intelligence of the system, and hardware components attached to the system.

5. Hardware
The System (APP)  will be compatible with Mobile Phone (Android OS 7 ++)

6. Software
In developing this system the software technologies will be used:
Adobe Xd: Will be used to Design the UI (User Interface) 
Java Programming: Will be used to Programming back end of the system
Android Xml: Will be used to design the Front end of the System
Firebase: Will be used for the system database, authentication
GitHub: The repositories hosting
